# xboxapi
Go wrapper for https://xboxapi.com/

The Clients API is not complete yet, nor necessarily stable. Specifically I need to deal with rate limiting in some niceish way...

Also the server API does not always return clean data (probably because the source data is unclean, or on account of things moving around inside xbox live underneath the xboxapi service. I work around this for you where I notice it happening and I can do so.
